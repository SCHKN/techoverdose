front-page

How? Why? 
Gitfront was build with React and Redux. This project served as a basis for me to learn asynchronicity in Redux and middlewares. This project focuses on front-end, especially around VueJS, React, Angular and Ember, which are in 2018 the most popular front-end frameworks. 
Gitfront uses Webpack as a module bundler and Travis for continuous integration.
