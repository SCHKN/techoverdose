</h1>

Gitfront was build with React and Redux. This project served as a basis for me to learn asynchronicity in Redux and middlewares.
This project focuses on front-end, especially around <b>VueJS, React, Angular and Ember</b>, which are in 2018 the most popular front-end frameworks. <br>
Gitfront uses <b>Webpack</b> as a module bundler and <b>Travis</b> for continuous integration.
